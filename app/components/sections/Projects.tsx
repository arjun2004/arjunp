          description="I developed a predictive model that forecasts cryptocurrency prices using an LSTM network. To gauge market mood, it performs sentiment analysis on real-time tweets with a hybrid LSTM-VADER model, fusing deep learning with rule-based scoring for higher accuracy. A final decision layer integrates both price trends and public sentiment to recommend the most promising cryptocurrencies."

          description="I built an adaptive learning assistant powered by LLaMA models, featuring voice commands and image-based interaction. The key feature is an engagement detection system using OpenCV and a Facial Expression Recognition (FER) model to analyze the user's emotional cues. This feedback allows the chatbot to dynamically adjust its responses to maintain student attention, all within an interactive UI built with Streamlit."

          description="I developed a responsive college website, focusing on a seamless user experience across all devices. Starting with Figma wireframes, I translated the designs into production-ready pages using a modern tech stack: ReactJS, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. I implemented a mobile-first approach with Tailwind's grid and flexbox utilities to ensure the layout was both fluid and intuitive."
